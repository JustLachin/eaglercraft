
Quick Start Guide:
------------------

This is a plugin designed to be used with BungeeCord to allow Eaglercraft players to join your BungeeCord server

It is assumed that the reader already knows what BungeeCord is and has a working server set up that is joinable via java edition

If you don't know what BungeeCord is, please research the topic yourself first before continuing

Waterfall and FlameCord have also been tested, but EaglerXBungee was natively compiled against BungeeCord



WARNING: This plugin is very sensitive to what the specific version of BungeeCord, Waterfall, or FlameCord is used by the server

If you get errors, the recommended version of BungeeCord/Waterfall/FlameCord to use is printed to the console when the plugin is loaded

No other forks of BungeeCord are officially supported, although many forks will still work perfectly fine



Instructions:

1. Place the "EaglerXBungee-1.0.10.jar" file in your BungeeCord server's "plugins" directory

2. Edit the BungeeCord config.yml and set "online_mode:" to "false"

3. Edit server.properties on the backend minecraft server to set "online-mode=false"

4. Start the servers, wait for it to load

5. Once loaded, use the offline download version of EaglercraftX 1.8 and "Direct Connect" to "ws://localhost:8081/" from the multiplayer menu

6. If you are using a VPS, replace "localhost" with the IP address of the VPS when you connect

7. To add HTTPS support to your server and connect to it via the "wss://" protocol, use a reverse proxy like nginx



In this configuration, any player will be able to join your server using any username, which goes against the Minecraft EULA

Although it is against the rules, I don't know of any record of Mojang filing a complaint against a server owner just for allowing Eaglercraft players to join, so you're probably safe



If you would like your players to use their real Microsoft account to login instead, do the following:

1. Edit the BungeeCord config.yml and set "online_mode:" to "true" again

2. Start the servers, wait for it to load

3. Join the BungeeCord server using Minecraft Java Edition while logged into your Microsoft account

4. Run the "/eagler" command, it will give you a temporary login code

5. Disconnect from the server, launch EaglercraftX 1.8 and set your profile username to the username of your Microsoft account

6. Join the server using EaglercraftX 1.8, when prompted enter the temporary login code into the password field on the login screen

7. EaglerXBungee will log you into the server as the Microsoft account you generated the login code with



These are only a handful of all the features included with EaglerXBungee, this guide is incomplete

Look in the README of the EaglercraftX 1.8 github repository for (maybe) more details on the config files
